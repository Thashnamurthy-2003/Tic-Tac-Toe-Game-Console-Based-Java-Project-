This is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java. The game allows two players to compete against each other in a classic 3x3 grid. Players take turns to mark their respective symbols (X or O) on the grid, with the objective of placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. The game detects when a player wins or when the match ends in a draw.
